## ✅ Requirements

- Bagisto already installed

## 📁 Step 1: Upload the ZIP File

1. Login to your hosting File Manager
2. Go to your Bagisto root folder (where artisan, vendor, packages folders exist)
3. Open the folder:

packages/Webkul

4. Upload the Shiprocket ZIP file
5. Extract the ZIP file

After extraction, the folder structure must look like this:

    ├── Services  
    ├── Http  
    ├── Routes

## 📦 Step 3: Install the Package

Run the following command:
